## Welcome to Bojan Zunar's GitHub Pages

These pages showcase tasks completed during Coursera's '**Data Science**' and '**Genomic Data Science**' Specializations. 

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) provides online courses from top universities and, to students that complete a course, offers a [Verified certificate](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280196). Through ID verification, this document guarantees the identity of the person which completed the required assignments, thus ensuring academic integrity. Yet, while finishing the course highlights commitment, it does not illustrate what the students learned, i.e. what they can do. 

Most Coursera's courses include [Peer Reviewed Assignments](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208279946-See-feedback-and-grades-for-peer-reviewed-assignments), tasks which cannot be completed by merely "clicking-to-victory" and by answering interactive questions, but by implementing learned concepts to solve and document non-trivial problems reproducibly. This page lists few such reports to demonstrate the skills I acquired throughout the Specializations.

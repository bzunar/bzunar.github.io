## Welcome to Bojan Zunar's GitHub Pages
## _that are currently under construction_



These pages showcase tasks completed during Coursera's [**Data Science**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) and [**Genomic Data Science**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) Specializations. 

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) provides online courses from top universities and, to students that complete a course, offers a [Verified certificate](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280196). Through ID verification, this document guarantees the identity of the person which completed the required assignments, thus ensuring academic integrity. Yet, while finishing the course highlights commitment, it does not illustrate what the students learned, i.e. what they can do. 

Most Coursera's courses include [Peer Reviewed Assignments](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208279946-See-feedback-and-grades-for-peer-reviewed-assignments), tasks which cannot be completed by merely "clicking-to-victory" and by answering interactive questions, but by implementing learned concepts to solve and document non-trivial problems reproducibly. This page lists few such reports to demonstrate the skills I acquired throughout the Specializations.

     <summary>Assignment: Weight Lifting</summary>

    <small><p> </p><p align = "justify">Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har">(Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset)</a>. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.</p><p align = "justify">The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your machine learning algorithm to predict 20 different test cases.</p><p align = "right"><b><a href="">The R Markdown Report</a></b></p></small>

     <summary>Assignment: Shiny Nobel Application</summary>

    <small><p> </p><p align = "justify">You will create a Shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application. Deploy the application on RStudio's shiny server. Share your server.R and ui.R code on GitHub.</p><p align = "justify">Then, you will use Slidify or RStudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application with an html5 slide deck. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. The presentation must contain some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document.</p><p align = "right"><b><a href="">Presentation</a></b></p><p align = "right"><b><a href="">Shiny App</a></b></p><p align = "right"><b><a href="">GitHub code</a></b></p></small>
